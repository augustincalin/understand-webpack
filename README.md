## 01. Initial

This is the starting point. It's an "application" having only one HTML page (src/index.html). A style is linked (assets/styles/style.css) and a script (app/main.js) is used.

The page contains a button (Reserve). When this button is clicked, an alert is shown.

Nothing more. We want to use Webpack to build this "application".
